PubVis 1.0 is a visualization tool for the publication database (PubDB) of the media informatics chair at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t Munich which allows discovering different statistics on the work of the group.

Check out the [PubVis 1.0 live-demo](http://botterblaumenstengel.de/pubvis/).

##Visualisations
###Graph
Authors and publications in PubDB the are displayed in a graph. Vertices in that graph represent authors. Edges represent collaborations between authors. The size of a vertex corresponds with the amount of publications of the respective author. The stroke with of each edge corresponds with the number of publications both authors wrote together.

![Graph](https://raw.github.com/katzenfriseur/PubGraph/master/WebContent/img/readme/graph-standard.PNG)

Moving your mouse over a vertex will highlight the vertex and its next neighbors. Moreover the names of the respective authors are displayed next to the vertices.

Clicking on a vertex in the graph will take you to a page with [detailed information on an author](#authors-details) and his or her publications.


###World Map
A world map allows exploring the frequency of publication by conference-host country. Frequencies are color coded. Simply hover a country with your mouse to get the exact value.

##Interaction

###Data filters

###Application structure and navigation
The app is structured in a full page layout with different vertical levels and horizontal levels. On the vertical top-level you find general information on the app like help instructions. On the second level you find different graphics on the publications of media informatics group, like the [graph](#graph) or the [world map](#world-map). On the third level the [preferences](#data-filters) can be found which allow filtering the data set by time spans, author names, publication title or keywords. Further vertical levels appear once you interact with the graph.

You can switch between vertical levels by scrolling up or down. You can switch between horizontal levels by clicking on the arrows on the left and right side of the screen.



##Limitations
### Data set
PubVis 1.0 can only visualize data that's available. Some of the grafics use fields from PubDB that are not available for all of the publication entries. This is e.g. the case for the world map. Conference venues are retrieved from the location field specified in the BibTex entries crawled from the [PubDB main page](www.medien.ifi.lmu.de/cgi-bin/search.pl?all:all:all:all:all). Not all of those entries contain the location field. E.g. On 20.01.2014 PubVis 1.0 found 733 publications in PubDB and found 353 corresponding BibTex entries. Only 136 of these entries provided useful location information. Thus, be careful with your interpretation of some of the illustrations.

###(Input) devices and screen sizes
PubVis 1.0 was created in a quite tough time frame. Thus we were only able to test and bullit proof our implementation on a limited set of [environments](#tested-on). By design, the page layout is applicable for different device types, different screens sizes and different input devices, e.g. PC with large monitor and mouse as input device, tablet with touch screen (you see were this goes ...). However we were not able to optimize the app to run on all environments, but this should definetly be in the focus of [future work](#todos). 


##Tested on
The current version of Pub 1.0 has been tested on the following setup:
- Laptop with an 1920x1080, 12" display running Google Chrome on Windows 8.1, navigation with mouse: point, click left, scroll up/down 


##TODOs
- **Interop-Testing**: different devices: PC, Laptop, Tablet, Smartphone with different: dislplays, browsers, OS ...
- **More filter options**: *list* of author names, *list* of publications keywords (keywords have already been parsed from the BibText entries in PubDB)
- **Navigation/Interaction**: test and refine navigation with different input devices: touch pad, keyboard, touch screen ...
- **Bar charts** for annual activity are stretch horizontaly to fill a certain area of the screen. This leads to very wide bars in charts for data that covers a only little time spans.
- **Zero-padding** in data set used by bar charts for annual activity. In some cases there may be no publications for a year in the x domain. In the current version these years are left out in the diagram completely, which appears not intuitive or inconsistent. The values for years within the x domain were there is no data should be filled with zeros instead.
